        page1Title:'Introduction to Yield Farming',
        page1Content1:"What is 'Yield Farming'? This starts with the concept of AMM (Automatic Market Maker);the general tradition is that when trading cryptocurrencies on stocks or exchanges, most of them adopt the 'combing system'. That is, if you want to sell A stock at $50, someone must want to buy them at $50 before the transaction can be 'successfully combined' to complete."
        ,page1Content2:" If no one is willing to use $50 to buy A stock, your transaction will not be executed. When this situation occurs very often, we call it 'poor liquidity'. It is taken for granted that the trading experience is also bad for the client, as it takes a long time to complete a transaction."
        ,page1Content3:" Therefore, in order to avoid this situation, there is an institution called a market maker, which specializes in the role of the 'counterparty' in stocks or exchanges. If you want to sell, he can buy, and if you want to buy, he can sell, so as to improve the 'liquidity' of the transaction and 'mix it successfully'. It makes the transaction smooth, shorten the transaction time and improve the experience."
        ,page1Content4:" But in DeFi, there is generally no such role as a 'market maker' run by individuals or teams. The way to make up is to replace the traditional market maker with AMM (Automated Market Maker) to maintain each Dapp (Decentralized Application) liquidity, increase transaction rate and improve customer experience."
        ,page1Content5:" So who is the AMM? In short, anyone with spare money can do it. Simply deposit your spare funds in a specific Dapp, you can take the role of AMM maintenance and make profits. This behavior is called 'Yield Farming'."
        ,page1Content6:" In the case of a decentralized exchange (Dex), AMM requires users to deposit trading pairs of spare funds (BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT) into two pools in a certain proportion to provide 'liquidity'. That is, when other users want to buy and sell the trading pair, there are cryptocurrencies to buy and sell."
        ,page1Content7:" The transaction fees charged by decentralized exchanges to buyers and sellers will be fed back to 'liquidity providers' with a certain percentage of the distribution mechanism, that is, users whose funds are deposited in the pool, can earn rewards. In this way, every user can throw their tokens into the liquidity pool, which become a small market maker, and then enjoy the transaction fee dividend; Such a mechanism exists in both loan contracts and exchanges, resulting in the vigorous development of DeFi."
        
        ,page2Title:'Introduction to aggregators'
        ,page2Content1:'DeFi Liquid Mining, while low risk and relatively high returns, is the same deal that offers a different profit pair in a lending contract than Dex, and it fluctuates daily or even hourly, depending on the Dapp. User volume and profit sharing mechanism. Moreover, there are many types of loan contracts and Dex, which causes investors to be confused.'
        ,page2Content2:'To obtain the maximum return on investment of "Liquid Mining" with the same cryptocurrency (BTC, USDT, ETH, USDT), you must always pay attention to the above information. Moving funds in and out requires a handling fee, and the level of complexity is really unbearable.'
        ,page2Content3:'Another DeFi innovation that came into being - aggregator. Imagine an aggregator as a fund trader, facing thousands of "stocks" in the market (various Dapps in the DeFi field), that automatically help you choose the portfolio with the best return on investment on the market (automatically allocate funds to Dapp projects such as "borrowing" and "liquid mining" in DeFi to earn high returns).'
        ,page2Content4:'If you have spare money in a currency such as USDT/USDC, you only need to select the currency in the aggregator and put the funds into the aggregator (correctly speaking, it is put into the "machine pool" of the currency in the aggregator, such as USDC machine pool), and you can raise your feet and watch the profits roll in endlessly.'
        ,page2Content5:'In addition to researching the yield comparison of major Dapps, investors can also save the cost of handling fees required to move funds in and out (Gas Fee, which needs to be paid to miners in terms of access contract and transfer on the blockchain)). One click investment is no longer a fantasy after the emergence of aggregator.'
